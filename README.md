# Setting Up Vite Project from GitHub

This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a Vite project by cloning a GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Steps to Setup

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**

   Clone the GitHub repository containing the Vite project using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Once cloned, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory created during the cloning process.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use npm or yarn to install the project dependencies. Run one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using yarn
   yarn
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   After installing the dependencies, you can start the Vite development server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**

   Once the development server is up and running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Additional Configuration


- **Building for Production:**
  To build the project for production, you can run the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

  This command generates optimized production-ready files in the `dist` directory.
